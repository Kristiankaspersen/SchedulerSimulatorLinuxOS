                #     - Each IO device (disk, network, etc.) has its own waiting queue
                #     - When a process calls read(), it waits in the corresponding I/O wait queue until the data is available
                #     - Example: process -> waiting for disk read -> wakes up when read completes.
                # 2. Lock/Mutex Blocked queue
                #     - Each lock (mutex, semaphore, futex) maintains its own queue of blocked threads.
                #     - When a thread tries to acquire a locked mutex, it waits in the mutex's wait queue
                #     - When unlock() is called, the scheduler wakes up one (or more) blocked threads
                #     - Example: Process A holds mutex -> process B blocks -> A releases mutex -> B wakes up
                # 3. Condition variables blocked queue
                # 4. Timer based sleep queue
                #      - The kernel maintains a sleep queue for processes waiting on sleep(), nanosleep(), or usleep()
                #      - The scheduler periodically checks if the sleep time is over and moves the process to the ready queue
                #      - Example: process calls sleep(5) -> scheduler wakes it up after 5 seconds
                # I will wait wit this
                # 5. Process waiting queue
                #       - When a parent calls wait() for child, the parent is blocked in the process wait queue.
                #       - Once the child process terminates, the parent is unblocked.
                #
                # For simulation sake I can make different blockding queues that are more similar to each of these situations.
